# Course Planner

This program, created during the 2023 nwHacks hackathon, provides an interface for selecting and creating a plan for course selection throughout a degree. Users can add terms and select courses in each one, building a plan towards completion of a program. Additionally, the program will count the total number of credits the user has taken so they can see they reach the required amount.
